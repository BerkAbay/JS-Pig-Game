# JS-Pig-Gam
I made a dice game with JavaScript that 2 people can play. The player who rolls the dice must either hold the dice and press the hold button to pass the right to play to the opposite player, or he can roll the dice and increase his score, depending on his preference. But the active player should consider the possibility of losing points every time he rolls the dice. Good luck :))
